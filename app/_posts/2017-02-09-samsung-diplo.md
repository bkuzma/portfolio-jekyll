Developed a motion-activated mobile audio player app in AngularJS using the device motion JavaScript API. The app promoted Samsung's fitness products and would play an exclusive music mix by Diplo only when a certain threshold of device movement was detected to encourage dancing/running/walking/etc. Done while at R/GA.
